        <h1>Privacy Policy - Backyard League</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Playfinity ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects 
            your personal information when you use the Backyard League mobile application (the "App"). Backyard League 
            is a mobile game that connects with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor-enabled ball. We are 
            committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information when you use the Backyard League app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth Data:</strong> When you connect the Backyard League BLE sensor, we collect sensor data including motion data, acceleration, and other sensor readings necessary for gameplay functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Game progress, scores, achievements, gameplay statistics, and in-app preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We may collect approximate location information (if you grant permission) to enhance gameplay features. We do not collect precise location data.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, including session duration, features used, and crash reports to help us improve the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account, we collect your username, email address (if provided), and any profile information you choose to share.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the Backyard League game functionality, including BLE sensor connectivity and gameplay features</li>
            <li>To process and display sensor data from the Backyard League device in real-time during gameplay</li>
            <li>To save your game progress, scores, and achievements</li>
            <li>To improve the app's performance, fix bugs, and enhance user experience</li>
            <li>To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries</li>
            <li>To analyze usage patterns and gameplay data to improve game features and content</li>
            <li>To ensure the security and integrity of the app</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your 
            personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. 
            This includes encryption of data in transit and at rest, secure authentication methods, 
            and regular security assessments. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or 
            electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>
            Your game data and preferences are primarily stored locally on your device. Some data may 
            be synchronized to cloud servers to enable features like progress backup and cross-device 
            synchronization (if available). We retain your information only for as long as necessary 
            to provide the app's functionality and comply with legal obligations. You can delete your 
            data at any time by uninstalling the app or contacting us to request data deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With your explicit consent</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>
            <li>To protect and defend our rights or property</li>
            <li>With service providers who assist us in operating our services (under strict confidentiality agreements)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access your personal information</li>
            <li>Correct inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your personal information</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal information</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal information</li>
            <li>Data portability</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. App Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The Backyard League app requires certain permissions to function properly:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth Permission:</strong> Required to connect and communicate with the Backyard League BLE sensor. Without this permission, the app cannot connect to the physical ball device.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Permission (optional):</strong> Some mobile operating systems require location permission to scan for Bluetooth devices. We do not use this permission to track your precise location.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Permission:</strong> Required to save game progress, settings, and cached data on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can manage these permissions through your device's settings. Note that disabling Bluetooth permission will prevent the app from connecting to the Smart Ball sensor.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The Backyard League app may use third-party services (such as analytics providers, cloud storage, 
            or advertising networks) to help us operate and improve the app. These third-party services 
            may collect information about your use of the app. We encourage you to review the privacy 
            policies of these third-party service providers. We are not responsible for the privacy 
            practices of these external services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app may also contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible 
            for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy 
            policies of any third-party sites you visit.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Backyard League is designed to be safe for children and families. We take children's privacy 
            seriously and comply with applicable children's privacy laws, including the Children's Online 
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without 
            verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a 
            child under 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal 
            information, or if you have questions about our data practices regarding children, please 
            contact us at henrik@playfinity.com.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.             We will notify you of any material 
            changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page, updating the "Last updated" date, 
            and, when appropriate, notifying you through the app or via email. You are advised to 
            review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Backyard League 
            app after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
